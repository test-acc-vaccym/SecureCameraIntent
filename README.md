# SecureCameraIntent

Android example of:
Taking Photos Simply
https://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html

The secure side of the page. The part the demo left off....

DOES NOT WORK generates an error:
 Failed to ensure directory: /storage/sdcard1/Android/data/thackbarth.com.securecameraintent/files/Pictures
 
 I posted a question on stack overflow for help.....
